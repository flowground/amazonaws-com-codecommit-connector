This reference provides descriptions\nof the operations and data types for AWS CodeCommit API along with usage\nexamples.\n\nYou can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:\n\nRepositories, by calling the following:\n\n *   BatchGetRepositories, which returns information about one or more\n   repositories associated with your AWS account.\n   \n   \n *   CreateRepository, which creates an AWS CodeCommit repository.\n   \n   \n *   DeleteRepository, which deletes an AWS CodeCommit repository.\n   \n   \n *   GetRepository, which returns information about a specified repository.\n   \n   \n *   ListRepositories, which lists all AWS CodeCommit repositories associated\n   with your AWS account.\n   \n   \n *   UpdateRepositoryDescription, which sets or updates the description of the\n   repository.\n   \n   \n *   UpdateRepositoryName, which changes the name of the repository. If you\n   change the name of a repository, no other users of that repository will be\n   able to access it until you send them the new HTTPS or SSH URL to use.\n   \n   \n\nBranches, by calling the following:\n\n *   CreateBranch, which creates a new branch in a specified repository.\n   \n   \n *   DeleteBranch, which deletes the specified branch in a repository unless it\n   is the default branch.\n   \n   \n *   GetBranch, which returns information about a specified branch.\n   \n   \n *   ListBranches, which lists all branches for a specified repository.\n   \n   \n *   UpdateDefaultBranch, which changes the default branch for a repository.\n   \n   \n\nFiles, by calling the following:\n\n *   DeleteFile, which deletes the content of a specified file from a specified\n   branch.\n   \n   \n *   GetFile, which returns the base-64 encoded content of a specified file.\n   \n   \n *   GetFolder, which returns the contents of a specified folder or directory.\n   \n   \n *   PutFile, which adds or modifies a file in a specified repository and branch.\n   \n   \n\nInformation about committed code in a repository, by calling the following:\n\n *   CreateCommit, which creates a commit for changes to a repository.\n   \n   \n *   GetBlob, which returns the base-64 encoded content of an individual Git blob\n   object within a repository.\n   \n   \n *   GetCommit, which returns information about a commit, including commit\n   messages and author and committer information.\n   \n   \n *   GetDifferences, which returns information about the differences in a valid\n   commit specifier (such as a branch, tag, HEAD, commit ID or other fully\n   qualified reference).\n   \n   \n\nPull requests, by calling the following:\n\n *   CreatePullRequest, which creates a pull request in a specified repository.\n   \n   \n *   DescribePullRequestEvents, which returns information about one or more pull\n   request events.\n   \n   \n *   GetCommentsForPullRequest, which returns information about comments on a\n   specified pull request.\n   \n   \n *   GetMergeConflicts, which returns information about merge conflicts between\n   the source and destination branch in a pull request.\n   \n   \n *   GetPullRequest, which returns information about a specified pull request.\n   \n   \n *   ListPullRequests, which lists all pull requests for a repository.\n   \n   \n *   MergePullRequestByFastForward, which merges the source destination branch of\n   a pull request into the specified destination branch for that pull request\n   using the fast-forward merge option.\n   \n   \n *   PostCommentForPullRequest, which posts a comment to a pull request at the\n   specified line, file, or request.\n   \n   \n *   UpdatePullRequestDescription, which updates the description of a pull\n   request.\n   \n   \n *   UpdatePullRequestStatus, which updates the status of a pull request.\n   \n   \n *   UpdatePullRequestTitle, which updates the title of a pull request.\n   \n   \n\nInformation about comments in a repository, by calling the following:\n\n *   DeleteCommentContent, which deletes the content of a comment on a commit in\n   a repository.\n   \n   \n *   GetComment, which returns information about a comment on a commit.\n   \n   \n *   GetCommentsForComparedCommit, which returns information about comments on\n   the comparison between two commit specifiers in a repository.\n   \n   \n *   PostCommentForComparedCommit, which creates a comment on the comparison\n   between two commit specifiers in a repository.\n   \n   \n *   PostCommentReply, which creates a reply to a comment.\n   \n   \n *   UpdateComment, which updates the content of a comment on a commit in a\n   repository.\n   \n   \n\nTriggers, by calling the following:\n\n *   GetRepositoryTriggers, which returns information about triggers configured\n   for a repository.\n   \n   \n *   PutRepositoryTriggers, which replaces all triggers for a repository and can\n   be used to create or delete triggers.\n   \n   \n *   TestRepositoryTriggers, which tests the functionality of a repository\n   trigger by sending data to the trigger target.\n   \n   \n\nFor information about how to use AWS CodeCommit, see the AWS CodeCommit User\nGuide [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html].",
